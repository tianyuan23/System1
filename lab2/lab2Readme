Work on the lab individually.

Use about 6.5 hours on the entire lab.

A problem came across when I wrote the function print_result. At first, I only used one parameter option_num and then found out that there were no declarations for the parameters used in function minimum, maximum and four other functions for calculations. Then I realized the function print_out was calling other functions. After I added three other parameters in the function print_result, it went well.
